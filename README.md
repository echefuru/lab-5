## User Stories

- Barrett plays card games every day when he’s bored. He opened the program, registered an account and set a password. **[team story]**
- Barrett has two friends over and wants to see what games can be played by the three of them. He enters the game library which displays all available card games. He selects a filter so only games that can be played by three players are displayed. **[Amber’s story]**
- Barrett creates a room in the program, names it, and then Barrett selects the card game to play in the room, and the program automatically sets the maximum and minimum number of people in the room based on the card game selected. Barrett can access a list of players in the room or read the rules of selected card games. **[Jiakun’s story]**
- Barrett can set the mode to single-player versus the program, or multi-player versus other people. For single-player Barrett can select the number of program players, which will play the game relatively optimally with some variance. For multiplayer Barrett will be given a way to share his game room with others who can connect. **[Artour’s story]**
- Barrett can choose to play offline or online. For offline Barrett can choose the difficulty level of the game. The computer player(s) can adjust based on the difficulty level chosen. For online, Barrett’s friends who also chose the online option can join Barrett’s room by searching the roomID Barrett shares. Computer players can automatically join an online room if the number of people in the room doesn’t reach the minimum people required to play the game.**[Xiaoyi’s story]**
